## Walmart Sales Prediction Project 🏬🏬🏬
 🧑‍🏫**Overview** 🧑‍🏫

This project involves an in-depth analysis of Walmart sales data and the development of predictive models to forecast future sales. The process consists of several key steps including data exploration, exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, data manipulation, feature selection, and predictive modeling.

## 🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯Goals 🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯
* Understand the patterns and trends within the Walmart sales data.
  Develop and deploy accurate predictive models to forecast
       future  sales.
* Identify important features that significantly influence sales.
  Code Structure
* Data Exploration & Preprocessing: Initial examination of the     dataset, handling missing values, and preparing the data for analysis and modeling.
* Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing and deriving insights from the data using various plots and graphs.
* Data Manipulation: Transformation of categorical variables, encoding, and splitting of the dataset for model development.
* Feature Selection: Utilizing correlation matrix and feature selection techniques to identify important variables.
* Predictive Modeling: Implementing linear regression, Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet, and Random Forest regression models and evaluating their performance using regression metrics such as MSE, MAE, and R-squared.
